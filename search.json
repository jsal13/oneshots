    "text": "Story\n\nIntroduction\nThe biting cold cuts through the air like a thousand icy daggers, a relentless blizzard sweeping across the barren landscape. The land, blanketed in a pristine sheet of snow, stretches out in every direction, an endless expanse of white broken only by the occasional jagged rock jutting out of the frozen ground.\nThe howling winds whip the snow into a frenzy, creating swirling, ghostly shapes that dance and twist before disappearing into the storm. Visibility is limited to mere feet, the world beyond obscured by a veil of relentless snowflakes.\nOccasionally, a solitary, gnarled tree stands stoically amidst the snow, its branches weighed down by frost, a solemn sentinel in this desolate realm. The few creatures that call this place home are elusive and adapted to survive in these harsh conditions—perhaps a pack of resilient arctic wolves, their fur blending seamlessly with the snow, or a majestic yet elusive snow owl soaring high above, barely visible against the white backdrop.\nAgainst the backdrop of the vast, snowy expanse, a small caravan of covered wagons trudges forward, leaving a trail of deep imprints in the pristine white. The wagons, coated in a layer of frost, are pulled by sturdy, thick-coated draft horses, their breath forming misty clouds in the frigid air.\nThe wagons creak and groan with each movement, their wooden wheels struggling against the resistance of the snow. Tied securely to the sides are various supplies—bundles of firewood, barrels of provisions, and stacks of furs, all carefully lashed down to prevent them from toppling in the rough terrain.\nThe travelers accompanying the wagons are bundled in layers of furs and thick cloaks, their faces partially obscured by scarves and hoods pulled tightly around their heads to shield against the biting cold. They trudge alongside the wagons, occasionally pausing to help push or guide the struggling horses through the deeper drifts.\nOccasionally, the lead wagon stops, and a traveler wielding a sturdy pole hops down to probe the snow-covered ground for hidden hazards like treacherous ice or deep snowbanks. The caravan navigates carefully, each member playing a crucial role in ensuring the safety of the group as they press on through the unforgiving winter landscape.\nIn the distance, a foreboding mountain range looms, its peaks obscured by the relentless storm. Yet, there’s an undeniable beauty to this desolation—a serene, untouched purity that holds a silent allure, inviting only the bravest or most foolhardy adventurers to explore its secrets.\nIt will take a half-day, Eldrid says, to reach the base.\n\nThe blizzard picks up and the wagons are circled to keep out the wind. You sit in the center of the wagon circle with a few others wrapped in furs with a small fire burning in front of you. You have been paid by the Duke to keep this wagon party safe so that they might recover a particularly valuable artifact.\n\n\n\nSnowbound Ambush\nA shrill cry pierces the air, followed by guttural snarls from the snowdrifts nearby. Emerging from the swirling snow come a pack of Frostbound Kobolds, their scaled bodies camouflaged against the white landscape. There seem to be three to the north and two to the east.\nThe Kobolds, their eyes glinting with malicious intent, brandish makeshift spears and icy daggers. They dart in and out of cover, using the snowbanks and rocks for cover as they launch their ambush.\nThe treacherous terrain is uneven, with hidden icy patches that make movement perilous. The Kobolds use this to their advantage, trying to lure your party into these hazardous areas to gain the upper hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDM: The battle happens here. There is little chance of the party convincing these monsters not to attack.\n\n\nAfter the ambush, there is a quiet calm as the remaining members of the wagon party come out from their wagons. The sky begins to darken: it is almost night."

    "text": "Story\n\nTraveling to the Mountain\nAs the party journeys through the desolate snowy terrain, the imposing silhouette of the mountain range looms ever closer, its jagged peaks disappearing into the swirling blizzard above. The winds grow stronger, whipping up flurries of snow that dance in the air before settling on the frozen ground.\nThe mountain’s base draws nearer, revealed in glimpses through breaks in the swirling snow. It stands as a monolithic sentinel, its rocky facade covered in blankets of snow and ice. At its foothills, the party encounters a cave entrance partially obscured by a thick layer of frost, a potential shelter from the unforgiving elements.\nAs they approach the cave, they notice signs of recent habitation — a scattered pile of firewood, footprints in the snow leading in and out, and faint wisps of smoke escaping from within. The promise of warmth and respite from the biting cold beckons, yet the unknown mysteries and potential dangers lurking within the mountain’s depths remain.\nAfter speaking with Ingrid Snowcloak, Eldrid Frostbeard shouts to the party above the wind: “This is where our relic ought’a be. Close to this cave.”\n\n\nCave Ambush!\nAs the party cautiously enters the cave, the dim light barely penetrates the darkness within. The air is musty, carrying a distinct chill that seeps into their bones, contrasting sharply with the biting cold outside. The flickering flames of a small fire pit cast eerie shadows on the cave walls.\nBefore they can fully acclimate to the dimness, a series of guttural growls echo from the shadows. Suddenly, you see figures in the darkness — Ice Cavern Goblins. These goblins, adapted to the harsh environment, wear fur-lined cloaks and wield crude yet effective weapons crafted from ice and bone. Their eyes gleam with a predatory glint as they launch their ambush, hurling ice-tipped javelins. They seem to be in a defensive stance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDM: The party can either be friends or foes here. Fighting them will reward them with some loot, but making friends will allow the goblins to show the party where the relic — as well as a completely separate, but equally powerful relic — is located.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A{Party Decision}\n  A--&gt;|FIGHT|B[\"Get Ice-Bone swords, some firs, and gold.\\n  One has the relic.\"]\n  A--&gt;|FRIENDS|C[\"The goblins show the party where the relic\\n --- as well as a completely separate,\\n but equally powerful relic --- is located.\"]\n\n  linkStyle 0 stroke:red, stroke-width:4px\n  linkStyle 1 stroke:blue, stroke-width:4px"

The travelers, now joined by the party, quickly bundle up in their winter gear, preparing for the continued trek through the unforgiving terrain.\nThe caravan sets off, the creaking of the wagons and the steady rhythm of horse hooves on the snow-covered ground marking their progression. The landscape, though still desolate, seems slightly less foreboding.\nAfter a long but mercifully uneventful trek, in the distance the party sees the flickering lights of the village begin to emerge, casting a warm and inviting glow against the snowy backdrop.\nYou meet the Duke at the pub. He is impressed with your work. He rewards you with a sack of gold and a single basic weapon, as well as an invitation to dine with him the following night.\n“Since you made it back alive, you’ve proven to me that you can brave the ice and snow. I’ll speak to you at dinner tomorrow regarding a new contract. You should be well-equip to handle this one… though, it is of a more sensitive nature than retrieving the relic…”\nPerhaps he is referring to the number of children over the past few months that have either gone missing or have been found exsanguinated. Perhaps not. The party will find out next time."
