### Introduction

The biting cold cuts through the air like a thousand icy daggers, a relentless blizzard sweeping across the barren landscape. The land, blanketed in a pristine sheet of snow, stretches out in every direction, an endless expanse of white broken only by the occasional jagged rock jutting out of the frozen ground.

The howling winds whip the snow into a frenzy, creating swirling, ghostly shapes that dance and twist before disappearing into the storm. **Visibility is limited to mere feet, the world beyond obscured by a veil of relentless snowflakes.**

Occasionally, a solitary, gnarled tree stands stoically amidst the snow, its branches weighed down by frost, a solemn sentinel in this desolate realm. The few creatures that call this place home are elusive and adapted to survive in these harsh conditions—perhaps a pack of resilient arctic wolves, their fur blending seamlessly with the snow, or a majestic yet elusive snow owl soaring high above, barely visible against the white backdrop.

Against the backdrop of the vast, snowy expanse, a small caravan of covered wagons trudges forward, leaving a trail of deep imprints in the pristine white. The wagons, coated in a layer of frost, are pulled by sturdy, thick-coated draft horses, their breath forming misty clouds in the frigid air.

The wagons creak and groan with each movement, their wooden wheels struggling against the resistance of the snow. Tied securely to the sides are various supplies—bundles of firewood, barrels of provisions, and stacks of furs, all carefully lashed down to prevent them from toppling in the rough terrain.

The travelers accompanying the wagons are bundled in layers of furs and thick cloaks, their faces partially obscured by scarves and hoods pulled tightly around their heads to shield against the biting cold. They trudge alongside the wagons, occasionally pausing to help push or guide the struggling horses through the deeper drifts.

Occasionally, the lead wagon stops, and a traveler wielding a sturdy pole hops down to probe the snow-covered ground for hidden hazards like treacherous ice or deep snowbanks. The caravan navigates carefully, each member playing a crucial role in ensuring the safety of the group as they press on through the unforgiving winter landscape.

**In the distance, a foreboding mountain range looms, its peaks obscured by the relentless storm.** Yet, there's an undeniable beauty to this desolation—a serene, untouched purity that holds a silent allure, inviting only the bravest or most foolhardy adventurers to explore its secrets.  

**It will take a half-day, Eldrid says, to reach the base.**

**The blizzard picks up and the wagons are circled to keep out the wind.  You sit in the center of the wagon circle with a few others wrapped in furs with a small fire burning in front of you.  You have been paid by the Duke to keep this wagon party safe so that they might recover a particularly valuable artifact.**
