### The Grateful Abbey

The air within the abbey carries a palpable sense of relief and gratitude as the chaos of battle fades into the past. In the aftermath of the successful defense against the goblin raid, a serene atmosphere returns, albeit tinged with the scars of recent conflict.

Elder Wilhelmina, her gaze softened with gratitude and admiration, stands at the forefront of the gathered residents. Her weathered face, usually etched with concern, now holds a radiant smile. She steps forward, the weight of responsibility momentarily lifted from her shoulders.

"Dear friends," she begins, her voice carrying a warmth that spreads through the assembly, "words cannot express the depth of our gratitude. You've defended our sanctuary, stood alongside us in our hour of need, and through your valor and determination, you've preserved the safety of our home."

**DM**: If Lena is alive and around, you may add the following.

Amidst the heartfelt thanks, Lena, the young orphan, shyly steps forward, clutching hand-drawn sketches of the adventurers in action. "I drew these for you," she murmurs, her eyes wide with admiration and gratitude. "So you won't forget how brave you were!"

Elder Wilhelmina gives you a cup of yellow-green liquid which smells like oil and tastes like licorice.  You and the party have a few cups over dinner.  You sleep well in the Abbey dorms that night.
