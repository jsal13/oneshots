### Approaching Goblin Camp

As the party traverses through the dense forest, the air grows thick with the earthy scent of moss and damp foliage. The path ahead gradually narrows.  The distant sounds of discordant voices and the clang of crude metal echo through the woods, growing louder as the adventurers draw closer. Ahead, a faint haze of smoke rises lazily through the trees, marking the location of the goblin camp.

Goblins, small and wiry, scurry about, their movements quick and erratic. Some sharpen rusty blades, while others tend to scavenged meats roasting over open flames. **There are five goblin scouts and a worg.**  A few squat figures engage in an animated argument, their guttural language filled with gruff tones and sharp barks.

The camp itself bears signs of recent raids, with stolen goods piled haphazardly and captured livestock penned in makeshift enclosures.

The adventurers have a moment to strategize and observe, hidden in the cover of the forest's edge.

**DM**: The goblins will not be friends with the party, but, you know.  Figure something out if they try that.

After the fight, there is a quiet calm as the party rests.  The sky begins to darken: it would be best to get back to the Abbey.
