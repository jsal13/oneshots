### Traveling to the Mountain 

As the party journeys through the desolate snowy terrain, the imposing silhouette of the mountain range looms ever closer, its jagged peaks disappearing into the swirling blizzard above. The winds grow stronger, whipping up flurries of snow that dance in the air before settling on the frozen ground.

The mountain's base draws nearer, revealed in glimpses through breaks in the swirling snow. It stands as a monolithic sentinel, its rocky facade covered in blankets of snow and ice. At its foothills, the party encounters a cave entrance partially obscured by a thick layer of frost, a potential shelter from the unforgiving elements.

As they approach the cave, they notice signs of recent habitation --- a scattered pile of firewood, footprints in the snow leading in and out, and faint wisps of smoke escaping from within. The promise of warmth and respite from the biting cold beckons, yet the unknown mysteries and potential dangers lurking within the mountain's depths remain.

After speaking with Ingrid Snowcloak, Eldrid Frostbeard shouts to the party above the wind: "This is where our relic ought'a be.  Close to this cave."
